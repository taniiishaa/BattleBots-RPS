An interactive, terminal-based Rock Paper Scissors game that pits human intuition against a randomized AI. This project demonstrates core programming concepts like **conditional logic**, **input validation**, and **persistent loops**.

## 🚀 Features

* **Smart AI Opponent:** Uses the `random` module to ensure unpredictable gameplay.
* **Robust Input Validation:** Prevents program crashes by handling invalid user inputs gracefully.
* **Human-Readable Interface:** Maps numeric data (1, 2, 3) to clear descriptive text for a better user experience.
* **Session Persistence:** Includes a "Play Again" loop to allow for continuous gameplay sessions.

### Logic Breakdown
I focused on creating clean, scannable code. Key highlights include:
1. **The Choice Engine:** Converting integers to game strings.
2. **Win Conditions:** Precise comparison logic to determine the winner.
3. **Control Flow:** A `while True` loop that manages the game state.

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/taniiishaa/BattleBots-RPS.git](https://github.com/taniiishaa/BattleBots-RPS.git)
   ```

2. **Navigate to the directory:**
   ```bash
   cd BattleBots-RPS
   ```

3. **Run the game:**
   ```bash
   python python.py
   ```
### What I Learned
Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of:

- Control Structures: Managing complex if-elif-else trees.
- User Experience (UX): Providing clear instructions and error prompts in a CLI environment.
- Data Normalization: Ensuring internal logic remains consistent regardless of user formatting.
